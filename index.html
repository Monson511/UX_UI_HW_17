                <p>
                    I specialize in UX Research through interviews, talking, working with, and empathizing for those with problems that I am trying to help improve on. A Gallup Strengths Finder test labeled me as Adaptable, Empathetic, and Deliberative. 

                    When not working, I love to go to the gym with my wife for weightlifting. Itâ€™s one of our favorite hobbies and where we met. In the spring and summer months, I also look forward to softball night. 
                    
                    Goals for the future are to help create better experiences for people through this industry change, learn to ride a motorcycle, travel more of the world, and see more bodies of water.
